# CTSE_Assignment3_Unity_AR

This repository contains the source code and assets for the Dinosaur AR mobile application developed as part of the Current Trends in Software Engineering (SE4010) module at Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology.

## Overview

The Dinosaur AR mobile application provides an interactive augmented reality (AR) experience featuring prehistoric creatures. It utilizes Vuforia for marker detection and Unity for the development of 3D models, animations, and interactive elements. The app aims to bring the ancient world of dinosaurs into the user's immediate environment, making it both educational and engaging.

## Key Features

- **AR Environment Integration**: Uses Vuforia's ARCamera to overlay 3D dinosaur models into the real-world environment.
- **Multiple Dinosaur Types**: Showcases four distinct types of dinosaurs: Blue Velociraptor, Orange Velociraptor, Green Velociraptor, and Stegosaurus.
- **Interactive Scenarios**: Each marker triggers a specific story involving the dinosaurs, creating a compelling narrative for the user.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to interact with the dinosaurs, enhancing the immersive experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to ensure ease of use and smooth navigation.
- **Enhanced Realism**: High-quality 3D models and animations for lifelike movements and appearances.

## Markers Used

Three unique image targets are used, each depicting a different dinosaur scenario:
1. **Marker 1**: A dying Stegosaurus being attacked by a Velociraptor.
2. **Marker 2**: Two Stegosauruses, one dying and the other mourning.
3. **Marker 3**: A battle between Velociraptors and Stegosauruses.

## Assets Used

- **PBR Velociraptors**: Detailed and textured models using Physically Based Rendering techniques.
- **PBR Stegosaurus**: Meticulously crafted models with realistic lighting and shading effects.
- **Realistic Tree 9 [Rainbow Tree]**: High-quality tree model optimized for mobile platforms.
- **Blood Splatter Decal Package**: Adds dramatic effects to the dinosaur interactions.
